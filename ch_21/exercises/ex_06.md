# Solution

1. As a standard rules, programmers can't use any identifier if it is defined in standard library. Also, identifier names that start with underscore and following uppercase letter prohibited for future use cases. In lights of this kind of information, probably standard library developers want to allow use of very general words like "upper", "lower", "digit" so they come up with this kind of solution.
2. `_ctype` is a lookup table for different kind of properties for every ASCII characters. It is a bitmask table for (probably) faster and efficient lookup. 
3. With bitwise values, the lookup operation is very fast and efficient. Since the classification values are precomputed, the program only needs to perform a simple array lookup at runtime. This eliminates the need for multiple conditional checks, making the implementation both compact and efficient.
