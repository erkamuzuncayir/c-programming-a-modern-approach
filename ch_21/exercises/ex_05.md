# Solution

According to the C standard, a parameterized macro that substitutes for a library
function must be “fully protected” by parentheses and must evaluate its arguments
exactly once.

`#define islower(c) ((c) >= 'a' && (c) <= 'z')`

It is fully protected with parentheses but evaluates its argument twice, so it is illegal.
