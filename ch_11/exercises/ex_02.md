# Solution

1. illegal, because `i` is an integer and `p` is a pointer to an integer.
2. illegal, because `i` is an address of an integer and `*p` is an integer.
3. illegal, because `&p` is a pointer to a pointer to an integer and `q` is a pointer to an integer.
4. illegal, because `p` is a pointer to an integer and `&q` is a address of the pointer to an integer.
5. legal, because `p` is a pointer to an integer and `*&q` is a pointer to an integer.
6. legal, because `p` is a pointer to an integer and `*&q` is a pointer to an integer.
7. illegal, because `p` is a pointer to an integer and `*q` is a pointer to a pointer to an integer.
8. illegal, because `q` is a pointer to an integer and `*p` is a pointer to a pointer to an integer.
9. legal, because `*p` is a pointer to a pointer to an integer and `*q` is a pointer to a pointer to an integer.
