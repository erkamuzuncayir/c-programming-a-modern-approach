# Solution

Flags that affect optimization:

    -O0: No optimizations (no expression contraction).

    -O1: Enables basic optimizations, including constant folding and basic simplifications.

    -O2: Enables more aggressive optimizations, such as common subexpression elimination, loop unrolling, and function inlining.

    -O3: Further optimizations, enabling even more aggressive optimizations like vectorization and more advanced CSE.

    -ffast-math: This flag tells the compiler to allow optimizations that may not strictly conform to IEEE floating-point arithmetic, such as ignoring NaN and infinity, reordering operations, and simplifying arithmetic operations.

GCC can perform contraction on arithmetic expressions, but the extent to which it does so depends on the optimization level. At higher levels (-O2 and above), GCC will perform constant folding, common subexpression elimination, and other optimizations.
