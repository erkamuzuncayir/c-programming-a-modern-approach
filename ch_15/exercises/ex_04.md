# Solution

1. `printf("Output if DEBUG is defined:\n");`
2. `printf("Output if DEBUG is not defined:\n");`
3. Because `DEBUG` will be defined before include header file.
4. Yes, the preprocessor will work from the first line to the last line, so it will check whether it is a macro called "DEBUG" at the include directive line.
