Functions can often—but not always—be written as parameterized macros. Discuss what  characteristics of a function would make it unsuitable as a macro.
# Solution

1. Functions can better handle side effects of assignments, but macros have problem with them.
2. In macro a preprocessor evaluates as 0 any undefined name, but functions are use garbage value.
3. Functions provide type checking, but macros doesn't provide.
